# LogicMorph

Algorithm Visualizer is a dynamic and interactive web application designed to help users understand how common algorithms work through animated visualizations. 
It simulates the step-by-step execution of sorting and searching algorithms using colorful bars and transitions, making learning more intuitive and engaging.
## "Visualize the magic behind algorithms with animations and color-coded steps." ✨

## 🚀 Features

- Feature 1 :- Supports various sorting (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick) and searching (Linear, Binary) algorithms.
- Feature 2 :- Easily re-run or reset the visualization to explore from different angles.
- Feature 3 :- Clean and organized code, making it easy to add new algorithms.
